This is an R package to refactor the association testing code in GENESIS into something easier to maintain and optimize. The code in this package will eventually be incorporated back into GENESIS.

The package will rely on methods in SeqVarTools to extract data from GDS files, and call the functions in genesis2_tests to do the statistics.
